"""The retirement bell (issue 765): when a cluster enters its warning window (`warn_days` before
automatic retirement), every user who can act on it, by changing its window or bringing it back
(`can_manage_settings`), gets one `cluster_retiring` notification. Once per silence, not once per
night: a `system-config` marker `retirement-warned:<cluster_id>` keeps the `silent_since` it was
sent for, so a dismissed notification (dismiss deletes it) is not sent again, and neither is one
for a settings change that moves the dates of the same silence. A cluster that scans and goes
silent again has a new `silent_since`, and is announced again.

Notification ids are derived from (cluster, user, silent_since) and written with
`op_type=create`, so a sweep that stopped between the notifications and the marker repeats none
still in the bell on its next run (one dismissed in between is written again).

A notice lives as long as its silence (operator ruling, 2026-10-08): when the cluster scans
again, or a return from retirement starts a new silence, its notices and marker are deleted, and
a later silence is announced afresh. A settings change that moves the dates keeps them. A retired
cluster keeps its notice; the bell row then says it has been retired."""
