"""Deleting a retired cluster (issue 765, ruled 2026-10-06): everything JAVV holds for one
`cluster_id`, except its audit rows. Manual only, `can_manage_retention`, and only after the
cluster is retired; the route checks both.

**What goes, in this order**, after a `system-config` marker `cluster-delete:<cluster_id>` that
says the delete has started (issue 778): while it stands, the cluster cannot be brought back, so a
half-deleted cluster is never put back on the list with part of its data gone.
1. its token docs, first, so a scanner still pushing gets 401 from here on;
2. its five history series (occurrences, scan-events, images, inventory runs, ingest failures),
   as whole-index drops. Indices are matched by exact name, `<series>-<cluster_id>-NNNNNN`, never
   by the `-<cluster_id>-*` wildcard alone: two valid ids can be prefixes of each other
   (`abcdefgh` and `abcdefgh-1234`), and the wildcard would take the other cluster's history.
   `<series>-<cluster_id>` itself is dropped too: a write to the alias landing between the drop
   and its re-creation auto-creates a concrete index under the alias's name;
3. its rows in the shared indices: `findings`, `javv-scan-watermarks`, `javv-scan-orders`,
   `system-decisions`, `system-reports` (with their chunks) and `system-notifications`;
4. its `system-config` docs: scan scope, the four per-cluster overrides, its retirement-warning
   marker, its registry name;
5. its retirement record, so a delete that stopped halfway still reads as a retired cluster and a
   retry finishes it;
6. last, the marker is stamped `finished_at` and kept as a tombstone.

**The next-night pass** (`recheck_deleted`, run by the retirement sweep; operator ruling on issue
778): a push already past its token check when the tokens went can still write after a step's
pass, and once the retirement record is gone no route reaches those rows. For every tombstone
whose cluster nothing names any more (no token, no registry name, no retirement record), the
pass re-runs steps 1 to 3, warns and counts when it found rows, and drops the tombstone once a
second pass finds nothing. A cluster onboarded again under the same id keeps its data and loses
the tombstone. A marker that never finished (a delete that stopped after its retirement record)
is handled the same way.

**`delete_by_query` here is a sanctioned use** (operator ruling on issue 765, named in the backend
rules): every query is an exact `term` on `cluster_id`, so it can only ever match that tenant (the
report chunks go by `report_id`, taken from that cluster's reports).
The append series are still whole-index drops. Every step can be re-run.

Snapshots taken before the delete still hold the data; deleting does not reach them."""
