"""scan_order allocation (D45) — the backend-minted, per-`(cluster_id, scanner)` ordering key.

The counter doc lives in `javv-scan-orders` (its own tiny mutable index — AUTHORITATIVE, unlike the
derived watermarks: rebuild-state never touches it; see CORRECTNESS-CONTRACT §2). Allocation is a
CAS loop on `_seq_no`/`_primary_term`, with a **forward-only self-heal**: the allocation base is
`max(counter, max committed scan_order in the catalog)`, so a restored/stale/fresh counter can never
re-issue an order the catalog already committed (and existing clusters transition seamlessly off the
old `time.time_ns()` orders — the sequence continues above them). Gaps from crashed cycles are fine:
the contract is monotonicity, not density.
