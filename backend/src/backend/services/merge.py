"""Partial-doc merge for the `findings` cache (D31/D16 — M3 slice 2).

Every scan refreshes the **scanner-owned** fields of a finding and NEVER touches the human/triage
fields — ingest must not reset an operator's `state`/`notes` (the M1 full-index write did exactly
that). The classification lives HERE and only here: the rebuild-state slice must import these same
allowlists, or merge and rebuild will diverge (CORRECTNESS-CONTRACT §6).

`first_seen_at` is upsert-only (a re-scan never moves it, D37/M13). The presence-field family moves
together (§7/§9): a finding re-appearing on a scan flips `present=true` and clears `resolved_at`.
