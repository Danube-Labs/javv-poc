"""Failed-ingest records (issue 357, option 2): one doc per rejected push, in the per-cluster
append series `javv-ingest-failures-<cluster_id>` — the data behind scanner status's
failed-ingests table (When · Scanner · Image · Stage · Error).

Only pushes that got PAST the token check are recorded. The caller guarantees it: the 401 and
the 429 are decided before any token is known, and a write per anonymous request would let a
sender choose our write volume. Past the token, the per-token rate limit bounds this write.

Routing is the token's scope, never the payload's: a `scope_mismatch` envelope's self-declared
cluster is exactly the value that can't be trusted.

Recording is bookkeeping on a rejection that has already been decided, so it must never change
that rejection: every failure here is swallowed and logged, and the caller re-raises the original
response untouched. Stored text is capped and stripped of control characters — `image_ref` and
validation locations can carry sender-chosen strings.
