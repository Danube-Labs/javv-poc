"""Triage service (M5b, FR-7/D17) — the ONLY writer of the findings human fields (merge.py's
`HUMAN_FIELDS` is the contract; `disagree` and the scan-presence family stay off-limits).

Write discipline: **CAS on the finding** (`if_seq_no`/`if_primary_term`, retried on 409 — a
concurrent triage or scan merge just re-reads and re-validates), `refresh=wait_for` (a read
immediately after the write sees it). Audit rows — one per ACTION — are journaled **BEFORE the
CAS write** (audit M-3 ruling, task A): journal-then-commit means a mid-flight failure can leave
an orphan ROW (a change that never landed — replay tolerates it: a lost CAS is re-journaled at
the winning revision, which dominates latest-per-field), but never an orphan CHANGE (applied but
unjournaled — the client retry would no-op and the change would evade D17 forever). Rows carry
the PREDICTED revision (`_version + 1` — exact when the CAS lands, since CAS excludes
interleaving writes); a duplicate row from a client retry at the same revision is
replay-idempotent.

Ruling (one-action-one-entry vs one-row-per-field): a `not_affected` transition atomically sets
`state` + `vex_justification` but is ONE action — one row, `field=state`, with the justification
in `new_value_json` (replay reconstructs `vex_justification` from state rows; leaving
`not_affected` clears it, visible on that row too). A human state write from `stale` also clears
`pre_stale_status` so the staleness sweep can never "revert" over a human decision — that's part
of the state action, not a separate row (system bookkeeping, not human data)."""
