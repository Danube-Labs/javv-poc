"""The FR-7 triage state machine (M5b) — the two-field VEX model, pure and side-effect-free.

Constraints are TARGET-based (FR-7 defines no forbidden from→to pairs among human states — ruling
recorded here): `stale` is **system-only** (the M3 staleness sweep is its sole writer; a human
override FROM stale is fine and wins over the system flag), `resolved` is **manual-only** (a legal
human target; the scan pipeline expresses "gone" as `present=false`, never `state=resolved`), and
the CISA-five `vex_justification` is required **iff** the target is `not_affected` — on any other
target a justification is rejected rather than silently dropped. "False positive" is not a state:
it's `not_affected` + a component/code-not-present justification (a UI chip, FR-7)."""
