"""The export sweep (M6 slices 5–6): a constant-memory full walk of one grid lens.

This is the SWEEP case of PIT + `search_after` (day-one rule): the PIT lives exactly as long
as the walk and is deleted in `finally` — success, error, or an abandoned consumer (a client
that disconnects mid-stream closes the generator, which runs the `finally`). No opaque cursor
here: the server owns the whole lifecycle, nothing PIT-shaped ever reaches the client.

Tenancy: pages are built through `tenant_query`, so the `cluster_id` term filter is
structurally present on the index-less PIT path (SEC-4) — same guard as the grid search.
