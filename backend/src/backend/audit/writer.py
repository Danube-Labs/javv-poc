"""The structured `system-audit-log` writer (M5b, D32/D17) — the ONE way audit rows are written.

One immutable row per field change (never prose); the row `_id` IS the `event_id` and every write
is `op_type=create`, so the log is **append-only by construction** — an overwrite is impossible in
code, and SEC-1's create-only OpenSearch role is the deploy-time backstop (Helm/M10). Replay
contract (D40/H-r3, D39/H6-r2): order rows by `(@timestamp, event_id)`; same-`(entity, field)`
edits order **by `revision`** (the finding's resulting CAS version) — no monotonic global counter.
Writes go through the `system-audit-log` write alias (M4 convention).

`append_field_change` RAISES on failure — a triage action without its journal row must fail (D17;
the caller's retry may produce a duplicate row for the same `revision`, which replay tolerates:
latest-per-field by revision is idempotent to duplicates).

`append_auth_event` has TWO policies (audit #188): **fire-and-forget for the login path**
(`strict=False`, default — an audit hiccup must never take down login/logout, an availability
tradeoff), and **strict for admin/token/config mutations** (`strict=True` — those are
correctness-critical audit trails; a mutation must never be left applied-but-unjournaled, so the
append raises and the caller journals BEFORE it mutates). Callers on the mutation paths append
first, so an audit failure means the mutation never happens and a retry re-drives it cleanly.

An optional explicit `event_id` makes an append **idempotent** (op_type=create → a duplicate id is
a replay, not a failure): a deterministic id lets a one-shot mutation (e.g. a decision revoke)
journal-first and still yield exactly one row under concurrent callers.

Versioning: `AUDIT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is the audit ROW contract, independent of the ingest
envelope's wire version. This module owns bumps."""
