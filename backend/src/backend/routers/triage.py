"""Triage route (M5b, FR-7) — `PATCH /api/v1/findings/{finding_key}/triage`, capability-gated
(`can_triage`; **risk-accept additionally requires `can_accept_audit_final`**, SEC-2/D33) and
registered in the standing RBAC/IDOR suite. The service does the CAS + journaling; this layer
only translates auth + errors (404 unknown finding, 422 illegal transition/patch, 403 caps)."""
