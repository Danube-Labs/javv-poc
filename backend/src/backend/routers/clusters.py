"""Cluster registry (M8c slice 2, #240 — the D-5 ruling): `GET /api/v1/clusters` + the rename.

One *document* in the existing `system-config` (`_id = "cluster-registry"`), not a new index:
`{cluster_id → cluster_name}`. `cluster_name` is DISPLAY-ONLY — never a query key, never in an
index name, never a filter (hard constraint; `cluster_id` is the immutable tenant key). The
listing is cross-cluster BY DESIGN (MVP tenant model D38/H9: all clusters visible to any
authenticated user): known clusters = the distinct `cluster_id`s that ever minted a token (the
onboarding requirement — a cluster cannot push without one) ∪ registry entries ∪ retirement
records (a cluster whose delete stopped halfway has only that left); unnamed clusters default
`cluster_name = cluster_id`.

Rename = `can_manage_settings` (admin), journal-FIRST per D17/#188 (the audit row lands before
the registry write — a journal failure leaves no applied-but-unjournaled rename), mirroring the
SLA settings write.

Retire and un-retire (issue 765, `admin/cluster_retirement.py`) are `can_manage_settings` too: a
retired cluster leaves the default listing and keeps its data. Deleting a retired cluster
(`admin/cluster_delete.py`) is `can_manage_retention`, the capability of every other setting
that deletes data."""
