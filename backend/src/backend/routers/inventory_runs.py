"""POST /api/v1/inventory-runs (M8a slice 2, D39/H4-r2) — the scanner certifies its cycle's
inventory at cycle END: "these `expected_count` discovered images should all have landed."
The backend counts what actually landed (never trusting a client-reported written count),
allocates `inventory_order`, and writes the immutable manifest — `committed` iff complete.

Token-authenticated with the same SEC-3 binding as ingest/scan-runs: the manifest is always for
the token's own `cluster_id`. Best-effort on the scanner side — a failed commit just leaves the
run uncertified (reads fall back to the prior committed run + the staleness banner)."""
