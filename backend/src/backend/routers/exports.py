"""The findings export surface (M6 slices 5–6, FR-13/FR-22).

- `GET /api/v1/findings/export.csv` — the inline "run now" CSV path: streams the current
  lens (same `SearchFilters` the grid uses) row by row over the constant-memory PIT sweep,
  every cell injection-sanitized (`export/csv_stream.py`). Scheduled/throttled exports and
  the `system-reports` queue are M7.
- `GET /api/v1/findings/export.vex` — OpenVEX / CycloneDX VEX document (slice 6).

Read = any authenticated principal (MVP tenant model); `cluster_id` is REQUIRED and forced
into the sweep by the tenant chokepoint — entitlement is re-checked on the export exactly
like any fetch (IDOR, api-design tenant rule). `as_of`: exports describe current state;
a past T is 501 until the M8b reconstruction can feed an export (D28).
