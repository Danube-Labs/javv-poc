"""The as-of-T dispatcher (M6 slice 7, D28/FR-23) — the M8b seam, typed.

Every read endpoint accepts `as_of`. This module owns the dispatch DECISION and nothing else:

- absent / `"now"` / a future instant → `None`: the route reads materialized current-state
  and NEVER touches the reconstruction path (the T=now short-circuit, DoD-pinned).
- a past instant → the route delegates to the registered `AsOfTReader` — M8b's `as_of_t`
  composition (occurrences ≤ T ⋈ decisions-active-at-T + audit replay ≤ T + images ≤ T,
  catalog-first by `scan_order`, D39/D40). M6 contains NO reconstruction logic; until M8b
  registers an implementation, a past T is `501` (`AsOfTUnavailable` at the seam).

Ruling (recorded on #31): no standalone M8b spike — this protocol + its contract tests ARE
the verified interface M8b lands against. A future T clamps to now rather than erroring: a
UI picker a few seconds ahead of the server clock is asking for "now", not for a 4xx.
