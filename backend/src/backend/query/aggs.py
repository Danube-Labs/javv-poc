"""Scanner-faceted aggregations (M6 slice 2, FR-12) — pure DSL builders.

Two shapes, both `size:0` (counts come from aggregations, raw findings never ship to the
client — server-side-everything):

- **Facets** — capped `terms` over WHITELISTED bounded-vocabulary keyword/bool fields
  (severity/state/scanner/…). Whitelisting is the "never aggregate on `text`" guard (NFR-1)
  made structural.
- **Groups** — one `composite` source over a whitelisted high-cardinality keyword dim
  (image_repo/namespaces/cve_id/…), paginating via `after_key` behind the same opaque-cursor
  contract as search — every bucket is reachable, none silently capped (DoD).

Every bucket carries a `by_scanner` sub-agg: per-scanner is sacred (the UI can always split;
a cross-scanner merge is never forced). The caller's SearchFilters context applies to every
body, and `tenant_query` (the chokepoint) forces the cluster filter on top at execution.
