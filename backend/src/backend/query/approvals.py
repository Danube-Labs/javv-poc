"""The approvals-queue DSL (M9d slice 4b) — pure builders for `GET /decisions/approvals`.

The rail returned by operator re-ruling (§8.5, on the built 4a specimen): the prototype's
Status/Approver dims + a CVE search, served HERE because client-filtering a paged fetch is
banned (server-side everything). `status` derives from `expiry` against a caller-supplied
`now` + warn window (the sla_clock cutoff discipline: derive at query time, never store a
verdict); `scanner` filters the COLUMN's value — `both` = apply_both_scanners, else the D22
scanner-specific subject. Facet counts are `filters`/`terms` aggs under the SAME lens, so the
rail always describes the queue below it (the findings-rail contract).
