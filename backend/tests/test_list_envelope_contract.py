"""THE standing list-response envelope contract (issue 538, out of 530).

`development/standards/api-design.md` § *List response envelopes* documents which key holds the
array on every list route and what `total` looks like. Prose decays: #530 existed because a rig
read `.data` from a route that returns `approvals`, and jq answered `null` — whose `length` is
**0**, a silent, self-consistent wrong answer that passes whenever the real answer is also 0.

Two guarantees here, and the second is the one that keeps the doc honest:

1. **Shape** — for every registered route, the declared list key exists and is an array, and
   `total` matches its declared form (`wrapped` `{value, relation}` · `bare` int · `absent`).
2. **Presence** — every `GET` route is registered or explicitly exempt *with a reason*, so a new
   list route cannot ship undocumented. Exemptions carry their justification inline; an exemption
   with no reason is indistinguishable from an oversight.

Deliberately data-independent: every probe uses a cluster id that holds nothing. An envelope's
shape does not depend on whether rows matched, so seeding would add residue and prove nothing
extra. That also means an empty array here is a *pass*, not a vacuous one — the assertions are
about keys and types, never counts.

⚠️ Route enumeration goes through `app.openapi()`, NOT `app.routes`. Since FastAPI wraps included
routers in `_IncludedRouter` (no `.path`, no `.methods`, no `.routes`), walking `app.routes` and
filtering on `.methods` silently yields nothing — see issue 540.
