"""The compose file is the second copy of the settings (issue 452): `deploy/compose/compose.yaml`
lists every backend setting with its default and a comment, like a Helm values file. The code
(`core/settings.py`) is the source, and this test keeps the copy honest:

- every `Settings` field appears in the backend service;
- every `JAVV_` key in the file is a `Settings` field or a name the code reads (the rule of
  `development/scripts/check-docs-drift.sh`: `JAVV_LOG_LEVEL` is read by javv_common, and
  `JAVV_BACKEND_URL` by the frontend server);
- every value is the code default, except the named set the compose file sets on purpose;
- the backend and frontend run the images a release publishes, under the release-please manifest's
  version, on lines release-please rewrites (a release PR gets no CI run of its own);
- OpenSearch runs with its security plugin on, and one password from `.env` reaches both the
  store and the backend, without being written into a container's command (issue 715);
- OpenSearch starts with `admin` as its only user: the demo setup's other users are cut from its
  users file before the first start (issue 736).

The Helm chart is the third copy (issue 725): `deploy/helm/javv/values.yaml` lists the same settings
under `backend.config` as plain values, each the compose file's default, except the store's
address. Its secrets come from Kubernetes Secrets, so they are not settings there.

Each value is written `${JAVV_X:-default}`, so `.env` overrides any setting without an edit to the
compose file; the default after `:-` is what is compared. Keys without the prefix (`TZ`) are not
settings and are ignored. No store needed."""
