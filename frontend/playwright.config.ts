/**
 * The E2E smoke suite (M9f slice 5, testing.md §4): a handful of fast, deterministic specs
 * against a BUILT frontend + seeded backend — the same environment the route-walk smoke uses
 * (CI job `frontend-smoke` starts backend/seed/preview, then runs both). Locally, point
 * JAVV_BASE at the dev server (defaults to the preview port) and export JAVV_USER/JAVV_PASS.
 * One worker, zero retries: the specs share one seeded store and must be deterministic —
 * a retry that hides a flake is worse than a red.
