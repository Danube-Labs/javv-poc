/**
 * The /inspect console (issue 406) at the browser seam — issue 460 §1.
 *
 * The route walk already proves /inspect RENDERS (`walk.mjs:31`, ready `.idx, .load-error`).
 * What it cannot reach is the two interactive loops, and the backend suites
 * (`test_inspect_route.py`, `test_admin_jobs.py`) already own the contracts underneath. So this
 * file deliberately asserts only what needs a real browser: that a click on the rail reaches the
 * editor, that ⌘↵ runs, that a rejection surfaces the backend's own words instead of a generic
 * failure, that a destructive trigger cannot fire from one click, and that the capability gate
 * holds for a session that fails it.
 *
 * Response shapes are NOT re-asserted here — that would duplicate the backend tests and go stale
 * with them.
