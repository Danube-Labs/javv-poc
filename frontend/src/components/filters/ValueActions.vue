/**
 * Include / exclude actions for ONE facet value (issue 349 §2) — the third part of the M9a
 * filter module, beside `FacetRail` and `FilterBar`. It sits wherever the operator meets a
 * value (a rail row, a grid cell) so "filter to this" and "filter this out" never require
 * opening the Add-filter picker first.
 *
 * Two things here are inherited, not invented:
 * - It renders SPANS, not buttons. Both hosts nest it inside a `<button>` (the rail's
 *   `.facet-row`; the picker's value rows) and a button may not contain a button — the
 *   prototype's own escape hatch for `.fpill-x`. Unlike `.fpill-x` it IS keyboard-operable.
 * - The +/− marks are drawn in CSS, not typed as characters and not added to AppIcon. Text
 *   `+` and `−` carry different vertical metrics in Hanken Grotesk, so a 16px box centred
 *   them by line box and they read visibly off-centre (operator, 2026-07-28); the ported
 *   icon set has no `minus` to reach for either. Two absolutely-centred bars are exact and
 *   cost nothing. The label lives in `aria-label`, so nothing is lost by having no text.
 *
 * Deviation on record (DESIGN.md §8.4): the prototype's filter grammar is include-only, so
 * this affordance has no prototype source. Operator ruling 2026-07-27 chose the ⊕/⊖ pair over
 * a per-value dropdown. Its at-rest-vs-hover reveal is a HOST decision — the visual states
 * live in `base.css` beside `.cell-go` because they key off the host row's `:hover`.

/**
 * Snap the bar onto the device-pixel grid (operator ruling 2026-07-28).
 *
 * This grid cannot place it there by itself: at devicePixelRatio 1 the bar inherits a
 * fractional origin from three independent directions — the table card starts at x.5, rows are
 * 37.5px (`--text-mono-cell` 12.5px x 1.5 line-height = 18.75), and column edges are
 * percentages. Everything drawn on it then straddles pixels: measured here, the plus's two 2px
 * strokes each smeared across THREE device pixels, and with different splits per axis
 * (0.75/0.25 down, 0.64/0.36 across) — which is why one stroke read thicker than the other,
 * and why the corners and a 1px divider fringed before them.
 *
 * No CSS can fix it — the offset is unknowable to the stylesheet — so the remainder is measured
 * and handed back as two custom properties the transform consumes, composed WITH the lift
 * rather than fighting it (see `.val-act-reveal` in base.css).
 *
 * Measured on the HOST's `mouseenter`, not the bar's: the bar hangs outside its cell, so the
 * pointer never crosses it on the way in and its own enter event would fire far too late. One
 * listener per instance, on the element that already decides when this is revealed.
