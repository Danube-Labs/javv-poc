## Why

Vulnerability tooling splits into two worlds: **triage tools** (DefectDojo, Dependency-Track) with
rigid reporting, and **log-analytics dashboards** with no concept of auditing a finding. JAVV fills
the seam: a real triage lifecycle *and* exploratory dashboards, over what's live in your clusters.

Three things it does differently:

- **Scans what's running, not a registry.** JAVV discovers the images actually deployed in your
  clusters and scans those: the vulnerabilities you're exposed to right now, not a catalogue.
- **Two scanners, never merged.** Trivy and Grype run per-image and are kept side by side. JAVV
  never dedupes a CVE across scanners. Instead it **flags where they disagree**, so you see the
  blind spots a single-scanner tool hides.
- **Every vulnerability is auditable.** Each finding carries its own immutable history: a six-state
  triage lifecycle (+ VEX and risk-accept), every decision journaled with who, what, and when, plus
  **whole-app time-travel** that rewinds every screen to any point in the past. Most tools have no
  concept of auditing a single finding; here it's the core.

## Features

- **Runtime discovery**: scan the images live in your clusters, per namespace/workload.
- **Per-scanner, side by side**: Trivy + Grype kept separate; disagreement is surfaced, never merged away.
- **Per-finding audit trail**: every vulnerability keeps its own immutable history, with each triage action, decision, and note journaled by who, what, and when, replayed in causal-revision order.
- **Triage lifecycle**: a six-state machine (five operator-settable; `stale` is set by the staleness sweep), VEX import, risk-accept, decisions that apply across scanners.
- **Whole-app time-travel**: a global picker rewinds *every* screen to any point ≤ now, reconstructed from the append logs.
- **Append-only audit log**: immutable, per-finding and per-user, exportable to CSV.
- **Multi-tenant + RBAC**: isolated by immutable `cluster_id`; capability-based roles, local auth + bootstrap admin.
- **Server-side everything**: every count and page comes from an OpenSearch aggregation, never computed on the client.
- **Dashboards & exports**: overview, running-images inventory, scanner status, contributors, approvals, SLA tracking, one-click CSV.
- **Data inspector + repair actions**: a read-only OpenSearch console and a small set of sanctioned, journaled maintenance jobs.
- **No external broker**: coordination is OpenSearch; jobs are Kubernetes CronJobs. No Redis/Kafka/RabbitMQ.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph CLUSTER["Your cluster · one per cluster_id"]
        direction TB
        SCAN["Python scanner module<br/>Trivy + Grype adapters, one JAVV-built image each<br/>run as CronJobs, kept per-scanner and never merged"]
    end

    subgraph JAVV["JAVV · central, never writes to a monitored cluster"]
        direction TB
        API["FastAPI async backend<br/>server-side aggregations"]
        STORE[("OpenSearch · single store<br/>findings · append logs · audit · config")]
        UI["Vue 3 frontend<br/>PrimeVue · Pinia · ECharts"]
        API <--> STORE
        API --> UI
    end

    SCAN -->|"scan envelopes<br/>token-authenticated ingest"| API
```

Ingest is authenticated with a per-cluster bearer token that is **scope-bound**: a token cannot push
another cluster's data. JAVV only ever receives pushes, so it needs no credentials for, and no
network path into, the clusters it reports on.

Deploy target is **Helm → k3s** (in progress, M10). Full detail on layers, data flow, and the index
model lives in [`docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[`docs/engineering/INDEX-MAP.md`](docs/engineering/INDEX-MAP.md).

## Running it

> **A packaged deploy is not available yet.** The scanners ship as published images, but the
> backend/frontend images and the Helm chart land in **M10**
> ([#41](https://github.com/Danube-Labs/javv-poc/issues/41);
> [#452](https://github.com/Danube-Labs/javv-poc/issues/452) is the first slice). For now JAVV runs
> **from source**, for local development and evaluation.

Bring the stack up by hand (backend + UI against a local OpenSearch, or the full end-to-end path
with real Trivy/Grype scanning a live k3d cluster) by following
**[`development/RUNNING-THE-STACK.md`](development/RUNNING-THE-STACK.md)** (paths A / B / F). On a
fresh Ubuntu host, `bash development/setup/setup-dev.sh` installs every prerequisite first
(idempotent; verify readiness with `preflight.sh`).

## Stack & toolchain

Python 3.12 · FastAPI (async) · AsyncOpenSearch · Pydantic v2 · Vue 3 (`<script setup>`) · PrimeVue ·
Pinia · vue-echarts. OpenSearch is the single store. Apache-2.0 components throughout.

Gate-tool versions (the ones that decide lint/type/test results, so local matches CI) are pinned in
**[`versions.yaml`](versions.yaml)** (D42). Bump them there; `development/setup/setup-dev.sh` reads
it directly and `development/scripts/check-versions.sh` drift-checks every consumer.

| Tool | Role | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Python | Backend runtime | 3.12 |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Python package/venv manager | 0.11.25 *(pinned)* |
| [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | Lint + format (backend) | 0.15.20 *(pinned)* |
| [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/) | Type check (backend) | 1.1.411 *(pinned)* |
| Node.js | Frontend runtime / toolchain | 22 LTS *(pinned major)* |
| Vite · Vitest · ESLint/oxlint · stylelint · vue-tsc | Build, tests, lint/type gates (frontend) | from [`frontend/package.json`](frontend/package.json) |
| OpenSearch | Single datastore | pinned in [`versions.yaml`](versions.yaml) |
| [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) · [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) | Scanners (per-scanner, never merged) | pinned in [`versions.yaml`](versions.yaml) |
| kubectl · helm · [k3d](https://k3d.io/) | Local k8s (k3s-in-Docker) | latest |

### Supported versions

The externally-owned scanners + datastore JAVV pins and supports live in
[`versions.yaml`](versions.yaml) (D41/D42). Renovate watches it, the **compatibility gate**
(`scanner-images` CI) validates a new scanner version before it's published, and a drift check keeps
the Dockerfiles + dev compose in step. To change support, edit `versions.yaml`.

| Component | Current | Also supported |
|---|---|---|
| Trivy | 0.71.2 | 0.70.0 |
| Grype | 0.115.0 | 0.114.0 |
| OpenSearch | 3.7.0 | n/a |

Scanner images are published per supported version as
`ghcr.io/danube-labs/javv-scanner-{trivy,grype}:<ver>`; an operator pins/swaps a tag in their own
deploy (JAVV never changes versions in a running cluster).
