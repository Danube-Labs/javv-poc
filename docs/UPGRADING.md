# Upgrading JAVV

This page tells you how to move a running JAVV to a newer release. It tells you what to check
before you start, the sequence of the upgrade, how to check the result, and how to go back to the
previous release.

The design note
[`docs/engineering/UPGRADES.md`](https://github.com/Danube-Labs/javv-poc/blob/main/docs/engineering/UPGRADES.md)
tells you where the index setup runs, and why an older release can use indices that a newer release
changed.

JAVV has three parts. You upgrade each part separately:

| Part | What changes its version | Where to find the version |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** (FastAPI) | The JAVV release | The release tag. `GET /api/v1/meta` → `version` |
| **Frontend** (Vue) | The JAVV release, together with the backend | The same release |
| **Scanner images** (Trivy, Grype) | You change the published image tag in your deployment | [`versions.yaml`](../versions.yaml) lists the supported scanner versions |

JAVV never changes a version in a cluster that you scan. You set each version as a tag in your
own deployment. To install JAVV, see [`DEPLOYING.md`](DEPLOYING.md).

## Before you upgrade

1. **Read the release notes.** Each release has a GitHub Release and an entry in
    [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). Then read [Version notes](#version-notes) on this page. They
    tell you what a release needs from you.
2. **Make a snapshot.** Use **Settings → Data & OpenSearch → Snapshot now**, or
    `POST /api/v1/admin/snapshots`. The request needs `can_manage_retention`. It returns 409 when
    OpenSearch has no snapshot repository. [Snapshots](CONFIGURATION.md#snapshots) tells you how
    to add the repository. The upgrade does not need the snapshot. The snapshot protects your data.
3. **Check the OpenSearch version.** CI tests JAVV with the version in `datastore.opensearch` in
    [`versions.yaml`](../versions.yaml).

## Sequence of the upgrade

**Upgrade the backend first, then the frontend, then the scanner images.**

1. **Backend.** Each new backend pod upgrades the indices when it starts. It compares each index and
    template with the schema version of the release, and it adds the missing parts. The backend
    opens its port only after this step. Thus it receives no requests before its indices are ready.
    You do not need to do a step manually.
2. **Frontend.** Upgrade it together with the backend, or immediately after the backend. A newer
    frontend can send requests that an older backend does not have.
3. **Scanner images.** Change the Trivy and Grype image tags after the backend runs the new
    release. A newer scanner can send a report format (`schema_version`) that only the newer backend
    accepts. `GET /api/v1/meta` → `envelope_versions` lists the formats that the backend accepts.

There is only one backend, and an upgrade replaces it. Thus two backend releases never run at the
same time. After you go back to an older release, an older backend reads indices that a newer
backend changed. This is safe, because each schema change until now only added fields. An older
backend ignores the fields that it does not know. A newer backend reads a missing field as empty.

### With docker compose

Each release publishes `ghcr.io/danube-labs/javv-backend` and `javv-frontend` with its version.
The `deploy/compose/compose.yaml` file of the release names these images. To upgrade:

1. Replace your `compose.yaml` with the file of the new release. Keep your `.env` file. It holds
    your settings.
2. Run `docker compose pull`, then `docker compose up -d`.

There is only one backend. Thus JAVV is not available for some seconds, while the new backend
starts and upgrades the indices. The frontend waits until the backend reports healthy
(`depends_on`).

To go back to the previous release, put the `compose.yaml` of that release back. Then run the same
two commands.

#### Upgrade from 0.5.1 to 0.6.1 or later

From 0.6.0, OpenSearch requires a sign-in. 0.6.0 published no images, so use 0.6.1 or later. Before
step 2:

1. Add `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to your `.env`. This is the password of the OpenSearch
    admin.
2. Add `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` to your `.env`. This is the password of `javv`, the user that the
    backend signs in as.

The compose file does not start without these two values. OpenSearch refuses a weak admin password.
[`DEPLOYING.md`](DEPLOYING.md) gives the rules.

Your data stays. When OpenSearch first starts with its sign-in on, it keeps each index, and it
adds its security configuration. You can also go back to a 0.5.x `compose.yaml` with the same data.
Then OpenSearch runs without its sign-in again. We did these steps on the real compose files, from a
0.5.1 installation with data.

#### Change an OpenSearch password

OpenSearch reads `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` only on its first
start with its sign-in on. It keeps the two passwords in its data. Thus OpenSearch ignores a new
value in `.env`:

- With a new admin password, OpenSearch never reports healthy, because its `healthcheck` uses the
  new value. The backend waits for OpenSearch, and `docker compose up -d` fails after some minutes.
- With a new `javv` password, the backend stops with "refused the credentials in
  JAVV_OPENSEARCH_USERNAME".

To change a password and keep the data:

1. Put the new password in `.env`.
2. Start only OpenSearch: `docker compose up -d opensearch`. It still accepts only the old
    password.
3. Load the new password into the security index of OpenSearch. Use the demo admin certificate in
    the image:
    ```bash
    docker compose exec opensearch plugins/opensearch-security/tools/securityadmin.sh \
      -f config/opensearch-security/internal_users.yml -t internalusers -icl -nhnv \
      -cacert config/root-ca.pem -cert config/kirk.pem -key config/kirk-key.pem
    ```
    The command ends with `Done with success`. The compose file writes `internal_users.yml` from
    `.env` at each start. Thus the file holds the two new passwords.
4. Run `docker compose up -d`.

`docker compose down -v` also makes OpenSearch use a new password. But it deletes all JAVV data.
The account API of OpenSearch cannot change the admin password: `admin` is a reserved user (403).

#### Only for OpenSearch started from a `main` checkout: load the missing users

Do these steps only when the security index of OpenSearch holds only `admin`. No release made this
state. A `main` checkout before 0.6.0 can make it, because OpenSearch reads the files for users,
roles and role mappings only on its first start with its sign-in on.

1. In `.env`, move the value of `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` to `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. In
    this state, `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` was the admin password.
2. Give `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` a new value. This is the password of `javv`.
3. Start only OpenSearch: `docker compose up -d opensearch`.
4. Load the three files one time, with the same certificate:
    ```bash
    for f in internal_users:internalusers roles:roles roles_mapping:rolesmapping; do
      docker compose exec opensearch plugins/opensearch-security/tools/securityadmin.sh \
        -f "config/opensearch-security/${f%%:*}.yml" -t "${f#*:}" -icl -nhnv \
        -cacert config/root-ca.pem -cert config/kirk.pem -key config/kirk-key.pem
    done
    ```
    Each file ends with `Done with success`. Sometimes the tool then shows a
    `java.nio.channels.ClosedSelectorException`. This message comes from the HTTP client of the tool
    when it closes, after the load. You can ignore it.
5. Run `docker compose up -d`.

The same loop loads a changed `javv` role. If a release changes the role, its notes tell you. We did
these steps on the real compose files, from an OpenSearch that a `main` checkout started.

### On Kubernetes (Helm)

Each release publishes the JAVV chart and the OpenSearch chart
([`DEPLOYING.md`](DEPLOYING.md#install-on-kubernetes-with-helm)) at `oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts`,
with the version of the release. Keep your settings in your own values file. Then each upgrade uses
the chart of the new release with the same file:

```bash
helm upgrade store oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv-opensearch --version <new version> \
  -f my-store-values.yaml   # only when the OpenSearch chart changed
helm upgrade javv oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv --version <new version> -f my-javv-values.yaml
helm test javv
```

The backend runs as one pod with `strategy: Recreate`. The backend runs the background jobs, so
two backends must never run at the same time. Kubernetes stops the old pod before it starts the new
pod. Thus JAVV is not available for some seconds, while the new pod checks OpenSearch and upgrades
the indices. The startup probe gives this step 300 seconds. During this time, the frontend replies
502, and the web app shows "backend not answering". Kubernetes replaces the frontend with no gap.

**To go back to a previous revision,** use one command. `helm history javv` lists the revisions:

```bash
helm rollback javv          # to the revision before the current one
helm rollback javv 3        # or to a specific revision
```

The settings and the images of that revision come back. The indices stay as the newer release left
them, and an older backend can read them (see [Go back to a previous release](#go-back-to-a-previous-release)).
CI does an upgrade and a rollback for each change to the charts.

**Upgrade the scanners last,** in each cluster that you scan, after JAVV runs the new release. A
newer scanner can send a report format that only the newer backend accepts. The `javv-scanner`
chart holds the scanner versions of its release. Keep your values file (`backendUrl` and the token
Secrets):

```bash
helm upgrade scanner oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv-scanner --version <new version> \
  -n javv-scanner -f my-scanner-values.yaml
```

When the refresh container changes, the upgrade starts a vuln-DB refresh. The refresh container
changes with the image, the DB source, `extraEnv`, `resources` or `pullPolicy`. The next cycle uses
the new image. To go back, run `helm rollback scanner` in that cluster. Do this before you go back
to the previous JAVV release.

**To change an OpenSearch password** (of `admin`, or of `javv`, the user that the backend signs in
as), see the
[`javv-opensearch` chart README](../deploy/helm/javv-opensearch/README.md#change-a-password).
After you change the `javv` password, restart the backend. Then it reads the new password from the
same Secret: `kubectl rollout restart deploy/javv-backend`. The same section of the README tells
you how to load the `javv` role and its mapping into an OpenSearch that first started without them.

## Check what runs

| Check | Where | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSearch replies | `GET /readyz` (no sign-in) | `200` |
| The versions that run | `GET /api/v1/meta` (with a signed-in session) | `{"version": "<release>", "mapping_version": <n>, "envelope_versions": [...]}` |
| The versions that run, in the web app | The bottom of the sidebar | Three lines: `v<release>`, `store schema v<n>`, `scanner schema v<n>` |
| What the upgrade did | The backend log, one line for each pod start | The event `bootstrap complete`, with `app_version`, `mapping_version`, and the indices in `created`, `updated` or `unchanged` |
| The scanners use the new version | The **Scanner status** page, after the next scan cycle | The new scanner version for each cluster |

On the first start of a new release, `updated` lists the indices whose schema changed. Later starts
list all indices as `unchanged`.

## Go back to a previous release

- **The indices stay safe when you go back to an older backend.** The index setup changes indices
  only to a newer schema. An older release finds the indices at a newer schema version, and it does
  not change them. The fields that the newer release added stay, and the older release does not use
  them.
- **The older release can read the settings that the newer release saved.** The newer release can
  add a field to a setting. If you saved that setting, the older release ignores the new field. The
  backend logs `stored setting has unknown keys` one time for each setting. It counts each of these
  reads in `javv_stored_setting_unknown_fields_total`
  ([`API.md` § Metrics](API.md#metrics-metrics-prometheus)). If you **save** that setting while the
  older release runs, the older release saves only the fields that it knows. After you upgrade
  again, the new field has its default value. This is true when you go back to 0.4.8 or later.
- **Go back with the scanners first** when the report format changed between the two releases.
  Then the scanners do not send a format that the older backend refuses.
- **A snapshot does not give a rollback in one step.** A restore makes `restored-*` copies next to
  the live indices. It never writes over them
  (`POST /api/v1/admin/snapshots/{snapshot_name}/restore`). To use a copy, you must move it into
  place manually.

## The first run of the background jobs

From 0.5.0, **the backend starts its own background jobs.** On an installation that ran these jobs
only manually, or never, the first scheduled runs do all the work at the same time:

- **The lifecycle sweep** (03:00 by default) deletes all scan history that is older than the
  retention of each cluster (90 days by default). After this, time travel cannot show that period.
  Before the jobs run for the first time, see what the sweep will do: **Data inspector → Repair
  actions → Lifecycle sweep → Dry run**. If it deletes more than you want, increase the retention in
  **Settings → Data & OpenSearch**.
- **The staleness sweep** (02:00) marks as stale each finding that no scan found again for 3 days. It
  also marks as stale all findings of a scanner that sent nothing for 7 days.
- **The findings cleanup** (04:00) deletes the findings that no scan reported for longer than its
  period (180 days).

A job does not run because the backend started. Each job waits for its next scheduled time. To
stop all the jobs, start the backend with `JAVV_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false`. To stop one job, set its
`JAVV_JOB_<KIND>_CRON` to an empty value. [Job schedules and the time zone](CONFIGURATION.md#job-schedules-and-the-time-zone) gives the
schedules, and the time zone that the backend uses for them.

If you ran these jobs from your own cron or from CronJobs, delete them. The scheduler of the
backend replaces them. If both run, nothing breaks: the backend does not start a job that is
already running. But the second run is work for no result.

## Version notes

A release gets an entry here when it needs something from you. These are the conditions:

- The store schema changed (`mapping_version`).
- The report formats that the backend accepts changed (`envelope_versions`).
- The scanner images must be published again, or changed together with the release.

The entries start with 0.6. Before 0.6, each schema change only added fields, and the backend
applied it automatically on the first start.

| Release | Store schema | Report formats accepted | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(no entries yet)* | | | |

### 0.7.0: `JAVV_TOKEN_PEPPER` is now `JAVV_SECRET_KEY`

Only the name changes. **Keep the same value.** If you change the value, every scanner gets 401,
every user must sign in again, and every open download link stops working. The stored data cannot
restore them, and each scanner then needs a new token. A backend that finds the old name stops at
start, and it shows the new name.

- **docker compose:** in `.env`, change the name of the variable, and keep its value:
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/^JAVV_TOKEN_PEPPER=/JAVV_SECRET_KEY=/' .env
  ```
  Until you do this, `docker compose up` stops with `set JAVV_SECRET_KEY in .env`.
- **Helm, with the value in your values file:** change the name `secrets.tokenPepper` to
  `secrets.secretKey`, and keep its value. Until you do this, the upgrade stops with
  `additional properties 'tokenPepper' not allowed`. If you set the value with `--set`, get your
  values first (`helm get values javv -o yaml > values.yaml`). Change the name in that file. Then
  upgrade with `-f values.yaml`.
- **Helm, with `secrets.existingSecret`:** the chart now reads the key `secret-key` from that
  Secret. Before the upgrade, copy the value of `token-pepper` into it:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch secret <your-secret> --type merge -p \
    "{\"data\":{\"secret-key\":\"$(kubectl get secret <your-secret> -o jsonpath='{.data.token-pepper}')\"}}"
  ```
  After the upgrade works, delete the key `token-pepper`.

### 0.6.2: JAVV retires clusters that send no scans

A new daily job retires a cluster that sent no accepted scan for 45 days
(`JAVV_CLUSTER_RETIRE_AFTER_DAYS`). A retired cluster is not in the cluster list, in the cluster
selector or in All clusters. JAVV keeps all of its data and its tokens. The cluster comes back with
its next accepted scan. You can also bring it back manually:
`POST /api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/unretire`.

The first run (04:15 by default) retires each cluster that sent no scan for that time. An example
is a cluster that you made again: it comes back with a new ID. To keep a cluster, do one of these
steps:

- Set its period to never: `PUT /api/v1/settings/retirement` with its `cluster_id`,
  `retire_after_days: null`, and `warn_days` as before.
- Set `JAVV_CLUSTER_RETIRE_AFTER_DAYS=0` to stop retirement for all clusters.

When no cluster had an accepted scan within its scanner-down period, the job retires nothing, and
it logs a warning. This condition shows a problem in JAVV, not in the clusters.

### 0.6.0: how the backend connects to OpenSearch

There are two changes, both on purpose:

- **A `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_URL` that holds a user or a password stops the backend at start.** Earlier
  releases sent `https://user:pass@host` (or `user:pass@host`, with no scheme) to the client. Move
  the credentials into `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_USERNAME` and `JAVV_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD`
  ([Connection to OpenSearch](CONFIGURATION.md#connection-to-opensearch)).
- **A wrong setting stops the start, with one line for each variable:**
  `invalid settings: JAVV_<NAME>: <reason>`. The line holds no value from your environment.
  Earlier releases showed part of the environment, and secrets could be in it.

The token command (`python -m backend.core.tokens`) and the scan-scope command now also use
`JAVV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, as the rest of the backend did before (30 seconds by default).
