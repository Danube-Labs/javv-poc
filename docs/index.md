# JAVV operator docs

JAVV finds the container images that run in your Kubernetes clusters. It scans each image with
Trivy and with Grype, and it keeps the results of each scanner apart. For each vulnerability, JAVV
records each triage decision in an audit log.

These pages are for the people who install and operate JAVV.
