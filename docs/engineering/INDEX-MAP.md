# JAVV - Index map & mappings (v4)

> **Living doc** (formerly `INDEX-MAP_v4.md` in `docs/engineering/V4/` — suffixes dropped 2026-07-16, #410).
> The v1–v3 evolution trail is frozen in `.deprecated/`; version markers are reserved for frozen generations.

> **The single source of truth for every OpenSearch index**: name, partition key, rollover/retention, and
> pinned mapping. Supersedes the scattered field tables in `PLAN` §5.x. Captured 2026-06-21. All indexes:
> `dynamic: false`. Enum/casing fields use the shared `lc` lowercase normalizer (verbatim in `_source`,
> normalized for aggs/filters - D16). Companion: `FLOW-EXAMPLE.md` (worked example). Diagrams: Mermaid.

## Summary - rolls over or not?

| Index | Shelf | Partition | Rollover | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `javv-finding-occurrences-<cluster_id>-*` | append (history) | cluster | **yes** (lifecycle job: size/age/docs) | per-cluster drop-whole-index; **bounds how far back time-travel goes** |
| `javv-scan-events-<cluster_id>-*` | append (trends + **commit catalog**) | cluster (scanner = field, D38) | **yes** | per-cluster drop-whole-index |
| `javv-images-<cluster_id>-*` | append (inventory snapshots, per `inventory_run_id`) | cluster | **yes** | per-cluster drop-whole-index |
| `javv-inventory-runs-<cluster_id>-*` | append (**inventory commit manifest**, 1/run) | cluster | **yes** | per-cluster drop-whole-index |
| `system-audit-log-*` | append (human-state timeline + trail) | time | **yes** (fleet knobs; rollover-ONLY in the sweep - task F m-6, #143) | **keep long** - the sweep NEVER retention-drops it (no expiry in MVP) |
| `javv-metrics-*` *(v1.1)* | append (downsample rollup) | cluster | **yes** | keep long (tiny) |
| `findings` | mutable current-state ("now" cache) | none (field `cluster_id`) | **no** | `stale`/`present` are **flags**; `delete_by_query` only after a **long** window (D37/M12) |
| `javv-scan-watermarks` | mutable (per-digest commit pointer) | none (field `cluster_id`) | **no** | bounded by live fleet; prune with `findings` |
| `javv-scan-orders` | mutable (**authoritative** `scan_order` counter, D45) | none (field `cluster_id`) | **no** | **none, ever** — `#clusters × #scanners` docs; rebuild-state never touches it |
| `system-decisions` | mutable (source of truth) | none | **no** | none (lifecycle-stamped; kept for time-travel/audit) |
| `system-users` | mutable | none | **no** | none |
| `system-roles` | mutable (capability bundles) | none | **no** | none |
| `system-tokens` | mutable | none | **no** | manual revoke |
| `system-sessions` | mutable | none | **no** | TTL expiry |
| `system-config` | mutable | none | **no** | none |
| `system-tags` | mutable | none | **no** | none |
| `system-views` | mutable | none | **no** | none |
| `system-notifications` | mutable | none | **no** | bounded delete (old/read) |
| `system-reports` | mutable | none | **no** | TTL sweep (`JAVV_EXPORT_TTL_HOURS`, default 24h) |
| `system-report-chunks` | mutable | none | **no** | TTL sweep with its parent report |

**Time-travel horizon = per-cluster, "as far back as the data in OpenSearch allows"** - i.e. the oldest
retained `javv-finding-occurrences-<cluster_id>-*` / `javv-images-<cluster_id>-*` window, paired with
`system-audit-log` (kept long) for the human-state dimension. Each cluster's reach is set by its own
retention.

## Append shelf (time-partitioned · roll over · drop-whole-index)

### `javv-finding-occurrences-<cluster_id>-*` - full per-scan snapshots (point-in-time scanner facts)
1 immutable row per finding per scan. `_id = hash(scan_run_id + finding_key)` (idempotent). Settings: 1
primary shard, monthly rollover.
```
@timestamp        date          scan time (one value per scan_run_id); display only - not the ordering key (D40)
ingested_at       date          SERVER-stamped append time - the retention age basis (task F m-4, same rule as scan-events/images)
scan_run_id       keyword       the snapshot's run (valid only if a scan-events commit doc exists)
scan_order        long          backend-allocated (D45) monotonic per (cluster,scanner); ordering key (D40/C-r3)
commit_key        keyword       = scan-events commit_key; exact-tuple membership for the symmetric query (D39)
cluster_id        keyword       tenant + routing
scanner           keyword
image_digest      keyword       reconstruction identity (content-addressed)

ptype             keyword       package type (M8d/B-1): "os" | ecosystem string; null on v3-era rows
schema_version    short
```
*(No `severity_rank` here - OE-5/D38; as-of-T severity sort uses a fixed order map
`crit>high>med>low>negligible>unknown`. No `status` field - absence in a later snapshot = resolved.)*
**Read via the catalog (R-CATALOG, D37/D40):** never `sort @timestamp desc, size 1` on occurrences - resolve
the **max-`scan_order`** committed `scan_run_id` from `javv-scan-events` first (order by `scan_order`, not
`@timestamp` - D40/C-r3), then read occurrences for **that exact run** (zero rows = clean image; a clean
rescan writes no rows here). **Symmetric "which images had CVE-Y at T" (D39):** Step 1 pages the
`javv-scan-events` catalog for the **max-`scan_order`** committed `commit_key` per digest ≤ T; Step 2 =
`commit_key IN {…} AND vuln_id=Y` here - **not** a composite "latest snapshot per digest" over occurrences.

### `javv-scan-events-<cluster_id>-*` - receipts + severity-count trends + **commit catalog**
1 immutable doc per (image, scanner, scan). **`scanner` is a field, not in the index name** (D38/M15).
**Authoritative commit catalog** (F1/R-CATALOG, D37): an occurrences snapshot is "latest" only if a matching
doc exists for its full `commit_key` 4-tuple; the point-in-time read resolves the latest committed
`scan_run_id` **here first**, then reads occurrences for that run. A **clean scan still writes a doc**
(`total:0`). `_id = hash(scan_run_id + image_digest + scanner)`. 1 primary shard, monthly rollover.
```
@timestamp        date          display only - NOT the ordering key (D40)

cluster_id        keyword
scanner           keyword
scanner_version   keyword       self-reported binary version (D41); Trivy Trivy.Version / Grype descriptor.version

schema_version    short
```

### `javv-images-<cluster_id>-*` - inventory snapshots ("running images")
1 immutable doc per (image, scan); each cycle shares one **`inventory_run_id`**, certified complete by a
manifest in `javv-inventory-runs-*` (below). **"Running images now / at T" = the images of the latest
`status=committed` `inventory_run_id` ≤ T** (R-CATALOG, D37/D39) - *not* latest-doc-per-digest, and never an
uncommitted/partial run; an undeployed image is absent from the next committed run and disappears at that run
(no sweep). `_id = hash(scan_run_id + image_digest)`. 1 primary shard, monthly rollover.
```
@timestamp        date
ingested_at       date          SERVER-stamped append time - the retention age basis (task F m-4, #143)
scan_run_id       keyword

schema_version    short
```

### `javv-inventory-runs-<cluster_id>-*` - inventory commit manifest (D39/H4-r2)
1 immutable doc per inventory run - the **catalog for inventory completeness** (the images analog of
scan-events). Written **last**, after the `javv-images` bulk for that run succeeds. "Running images now / at T"
reads only `status=committed` runs **ordered by `inventory_order`** (not `@timestamp` - D40/F-r3), so a partial
or zero-image run is never mistaken for the live inventory (a partial run falls back to the prior committed run
+ the staleness banner). `_id = inventory_run_id`. 1 primary shard, monthly rollover.
```
@timestamp        date          run completion time (display)
inventory_run_id  keyword       = the run's id
inventory_order   long          backend-allocated (D45 basis) monotonic per cluster; the "running at T" ordering key (D40/F-r3)
cluster_id        keyword       tenant + routing

written_count     integer       image docs successfully appended (== expected_count when committed)
status            keyword        committed | partial | failed   (only committed is read)
schema_version    short
```

### `system-audit-log-*` - structured human-state timeline + trail (SND-2; required for time-travel)
1 immutable, **structured** row per field change (not prose). Source for reconstructing human state at any T
(replay ≤ T in deterministic order, latest-entry-per-field wins) and for Contributors/compliance. Append-only
via a **create-only role** (SEC-1). Time-rollover, **kept long**. Schema enriched for faithful replay (D38/H8).
```
@timestamp        date
event_id          keyword       unique per event; tiebreak for UNRELATED events - same-(entity,field) order by `revision` (D40/H-r3); no monotonic counter (D39/H6-r2)
actor             keyword       user_id (or "system")
action            keyword       enum: assign|note|acknowledge|risk_accept|not_affected|resolve|reopen|
                                login|logout|pwd_change|role_change|token_mint|token_revoke|decision_revoke|...
entity_type       keyword       finding|decision|user|token|session|... (what kind of thing changed)
entity_id         keyword       the entity's id (finding_key for findings, decision_id for decisions, ...)
finding_key       keyword       convenience target for finding actions (= entity_id when entity_type=finding)
target_ids        keyword[]     bulk actions: the FROZEN set of affected ids (not a selector, not a count - H8)
target_selector   object        {cve_id, scope} kept for provenance; replay uses target_ids
result_hash       keyword       hash of the affected-set (audit integrity for very large bulk actions)
result_count      integer       size of the affected set
cluster_id        keyword
field             keyword       e.g. state|assignee|notes
field_type        keyword       scalar|text|json - how to interpret old/new value
revision          long          the finding's resulting version (CAS write); replay orders same-(entity,field) by this, not event_id (D40/H-r3)
old_value         keyword       scalar/text values
new_value         keyword
old_value_json    object        non-scalar before-image (when field_type=json)
new_value_json    object        non-scalar after-image
decision_id       keyword       links to system-decisions when relevant
schema_version    short
```

### `javv-metrics-*` *(v1.1, deferred)* - downsample rollup (cheap multi-year trends, lossy counts).

---

## Mutable shelf (single index · no rollover)

### `findings` - current-state "now" cache (the fast grid)
1 doc per `finding_key`. Scanner fields **partial-merged** each scan (a partial-doc `_update` of scanner
fields only - merge semantics leave human fields untouched; **no preserve script**). Human fields are a
**projected cache** of `system-decisions` + `system-audit-log`. **Reconcile-on-commit** (D37/C2): a committed
scan for `(digest, scanner)` runs `update_by_query` setting `present=false`/`resolved_at` on findings whose
`last_scan_order < the new run's scan_order` (D40 newer-scan-wins — not `last_scan_run_id` equality), so
resolved CVEs leave the "now" grid immediately. **`stale`/`present` are
flags, not deletes** (D37/M12): `delete_by_query` runs only after a **long** retention window (or once gone
from inventory that long), never on the freshness timer. Both create and update are **newer-scan-wins**: a run
skips the cache when its `scan_order ≤ doc.last_scan_order` **or `< the per-digest `javv-scan-watermarks`
watermark** (D40/C-r3 - the watermark also guards *creates*, which per-doc state can't), runs **after** the
commit doc lands (D39/H3-r2), and the reconcile `update_by_query` **retries scoped until zero conflicts**
(D40/E-r3). A crash before the merge self-heals via the scanner-cache rebuild (D40/D-r3).
**Presence ⟂ state (D39/M10-r2):** `present`/`resolved_at` (scan-presence) is orthogonal to `state` (human
lifecycle + system `stale`) - `present=true` = on the latest committed scan; `present=false` + healthy scanner
= resolved-by-scan (fixed); `state=stale` = scanner silent. Every "now" query **must** filter on both
(`present=true` + the screen's `state`) and carry `cluster_id`+`scanner`. Settings: `lc` normalizer; start at 1
primary shard (route/shard by `cluster_id` only if it ever grows large - it scales with live fleet, not time).
**Namespace is multi-valued (D30):** digest-dedup collapses N pods of one image into one scan, but those pods
can live in different namespaces - so `namespaces` is a `keyword[]` (matching the schema-v2 scanner envelope),
not a scalar. `finding_key` excludes it (a vuln is a property of the image, not the namespace). A namespace
filter is an array-contains `terms` match, so the **same** finding surfaces under every namespace it runs in;
per-namespace finding counts therefore **overlap** (only the all-namespaces total is deduped). Resolves the
`namespaces[]` vs singular `namespace` mismatch (project audit finding #1).

sla_clock_at      date           materialized D21 group clock (issue 363): min first_seen_at across the (cve_id, image_digest) group, cross-scanner, PRESENT rows - derived family like `disagree`, owned by services.sla_clock (recomputed per digest at commit; rebuild-state = backfill/heal).

state_decision_id keyword        projection provenance (M5c): the decision that set `state`; null = human/direct (direct action outranks rules); expiry-refresh finds projected findings by it
schema_version    short
```

### `javv-scan-watermarks` - per-digest committed-scan watermark (D40/keystone)
The serialization point that makes newer-scan-wins safe **including creates** (per-doc `findings` state can't
guard a finding that doesn't exist yet). 1 doc per `(cluster, scanner, image_digest)`. At commit the backend
**CAS-bumps** `max_committed_scan_order = max(current, my_scan_order)`; if `my_scan_order < max_committed_scan_order`
the run is stale → **skip all cache writes** (history is immutable/idempotent and ordered by `scan_order`, so
stale history is harmless). `_id = hash(cluster_id + scanner + image_digest)`. Mutable, no rollover; bounded by
live fleet (prune alongside `findings`).
```
cluster_id              keyword   tenant filter
scanner                 keyword
image_digest            keyword
max_committed_scan_order long     the watermark - guards both create and update of findings (D40/C-r3)
max_committed_scan_at    date     committed run @timestamp (display)
schema_version          short
```

### `javv-scan-orders` - the authoritative `scan_order` allocation counter (D45)
1 doc per `(cluster_id, scanner)` (`_id = <cluster_id>:<scanner>`) - the backend CAS-increments
`max_allocated_scan_order` (`_seq_no`/`_primary_term` guard) when the scanner `POST`s
`/api/v1/scan-runs` at cycle start, and returns the new order (pure Lamport sequence; never a clock,
never regresses; gaps from crashed cycles are harmless). **Separate from the watermarks on purpose:**
watermarks are *derived* (rebuild-state wipes + recomputes them from the catalog); this counter is
*authoritative* - an allocated-but-uncommitted order is invisible to the catalog, so a naive rebuild
could re-issue it. **rebuild-state never touches this index**; the only self-heal is forward
(`max(committed) > counter` → bump up, never down). Mutable, no rollover, **no retention ever**;
snapshot/restored with everything else (M2). **Also holds the per-cluster `inventory_order` counter**
(M8a slice 2/#33): one doc per cluster under the reserved scanner key `__inventory__`
(`_id = <cluster_id>:__inventory__`, same shape/CAS; self-heal floor = max committed
`inventory_order` in `javv-inventory-runs`, allocated at cycle-END commit).
```
cluster_id               keyword   tenant filter
scanner                  keyword
max_allocated_scan_order long      the counter - strictly increasing per (cluster_id, scanner)
allocated_at             date      last allocation time (display/ops)
schema_version           short
```

### `system-decisions` - scoped human decisions (source of truth; lifecycle-stamped for time-travel)
1 doc per decision. **Immutable except `revoked_at`** (D39/H5-r2) - a scope/justification **or `expiry`** edit
is **revoke + create-new**, never an in-place rewrite (mutating `expiry` would rewrite past-T reconstruction).
`revoked_at` is the only post-hoc stamp and is forward-correct, so the role is not "create-only" but allows
only that one update, and time-travel stays correct. "Active at T" = `created_at ≤ T AND (revoked_at is null OR
revoked_at > T) AND (expiry is null OR expiry > T)`.
```
decision_id       keyword
type              keyword       risk_accepted|ignore_rule|not_affected

created_at        date          = effective_at for a create
expiry            date          nullable; IMMUTABLE after creation - change = revoke+create-new (D39/H5-r2)
revoked_at        date          nullable; the only post-hoc stamp (revocation is a forward event → time-travelable)
effective_at      date          edit (revoke+create) shares ONE effective_at: revoked_at(old)=created_at(new)=effective_at (D40/G-r3)
operation_id      keyword       ties the revoke+create pair; projection runs only after both land (D40/G-r3)
cluster_id        keyword

# -- M7 STORAGE DECISION (2026-07-07, #32): result blobs live IN OpenSearch (chunked), NOT an object

#    (`GET /api/v1/reports/{id}/download`) gated by the tenant chokepoint + `expires_at` (410 once
#    expired) + a short-lived signed download token -- this SUPERSEDES SEC-10's S3/MinIO + presigned-URL
#    model for M7 (the token satisfies SEC-10's per-tenant + time-limited intent without object-store
#    creds). Retention = a `delete_by_query expires_at < now` sweep on these SMALL bounded ops indices
#    (the "drop whole indices, never delete_by_query" day-one rule targets the huge occurrence/images
#    time-series, not these). Orphan chunks (non-`done` attempt_id) swept alongside (D40/I-r3).

## Notes
- **Naming:** rollover (the M4 lifecycle CronJob, `_rollover`+`conditions` — not the ISM plugin; see
  PLAN D8) creates numbered backing indices behind a write-alias; the `-*` denotes the
  rolled series. Route append series on **immutable `cluster_id`**, never `cluster_name`.
- **Every read carries a `cluster_id` filter** via one tenant-scoping repository helper (SEC-4) - including
  both steps of the point-in-time symmetric query and the export drain. **MVP tenant model (D38/H9):** all
  clusters are visible to any authenticated user - `cluster_id` is a **data filter applied on every
  read/agg/export** (guards accidental cross-cluster bleed), **not** a per-user auth boundary; per-user/role
  `allowed_cluster_ids` grants are **post-MVP** (would slot onto `system-users`/`system-roles`).
- **Snapshot/restore** (NFR-6) covers all of these; snapshot the small audit/decisions indices more often
  than the bulky append ones (DR RPO note).
