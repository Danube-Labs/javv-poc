"""Build the current-only push envelope (D38).

One envelope per (image, scanner) per scan cycle. It carries the severity buckets
(D16/INDEX-MAP), the per-scanner findings (verbatim severity + EPSS/KEV kept), and run
identity: `scan_run_id` (unique per cycle) and a monotonic `scan_order` (D40 — the ordering
key, never `@timestamp`). `scan_order` is **backend-allocated** (D45): fetched at cycle start
via `POST /api/v1/scan-runs`, a strictly increasing per-(cluster, scanner) sequence that can
never regress. Per D30 a clean scan still emits a full envelope (no skip-unchanged).
