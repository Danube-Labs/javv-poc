This chart installs the backend and the frontend of JAVV on Kubernetes. It uses the settings and
defaults of the JAVV [compose file](../../compose/compose.yaml). It runs one backend, which also
runs the background jobs. It runs a frontend Service that browsers and scanners both use. The
chart makes Services only. For https, put your own Ingress, gateway or load balancer in front of
the frontend Service.

OpenSearch comes from the [`javv-opensearch`](../javv-opensearch/README.md) chart. The scanners
come from the [`javv-scanner`](../javv-scanner/README.md) chart, in each cluster that you scan.
[Deploying](../../../docs/DEPLOYING.md#install-on-kubernetes-with-helm) gives the full procedure.

## Install

The commands read each secret at a prompt, or make it in place. Thus no secret goes into your
shell history or into the arguments of a process. The commands need bash.

1. Install OpenSearch, with the password of `admin` and the password of `javv` in Secrets:
    ```bash
    read -rs -p 'OpenSearch admin password: ' pw && echo
    printf '%s' "$pw" | kubectl create secret generic javv-opensearch-admin --from-file=password=/dev/stdin
    unset pw
    kubectl create secret generic javv-opensearch-backend \
      --from-file=password=<(openssl rand -hex 24 | tr -d '\n')
    helm install store oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv-opensearch --version <version> \
      --set opensearch.javv.auth.existingSecret=javv-opensearch-admin \
      --set opensearch.javv.backend.existingSecret=javv-opensearch-backend
    ```
2. Make the two JAVV secrets:
    ```bash
    read -rs -p 'First JAVV admin password (12 characters or more): ' pw && echo
    kubectl create secret generic javv-secrets \
      --from-file=secret-key=<(openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n') \
      --from-file=bootstrap-admin-password=<(printf '%s' "$pw")
    unset pw
    ```
3. Install JAVV. The backend signs in to OpenSearch as `javv`, with the Secret of `javv`:
    ```bash
    helm install javv oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv --version <version> \
      --set secrets.existingSecret=javv-secrets \
      --set opensearch.passwordSecret.name=javv-opensearch-backend
    helm test javv
    ```

If OpenSearch has its own certificate, from a Secret or from cert-manager, also add
`--set opensearch.caSecret.name=<the Secret with its ca.crt>`. The backend then verifies the
certificate of OpenSearch.

Each JAVV release publishes this chart at `oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts`, and signs it
([Verify the images and charts](../../../docs/DEPLOYING.md#verify-the-images-and-charts)). From a
checkout, use the folder of the chart in `deploy/helm/`.

## What the chart runs

- **The backend:** one replica with `strategy: Recreate`, because a rolling update would run two
  backends for a short time. It has a ClusterIP Service on port 8000, and three probes. The
  startup probe gives 300 s to the first start, because the backend creates the indices before it
  opens its port.
- **The frontend:** `frontend.replicas` pods, and the Service that browsers and scanners use, on
  port 8080. The frontend sends `/api`, `/auth` and `/readyz` to the backend. It replies 502 when
  the backend does not reply.
- Both run as the user of their images, `65532`, with a read-only root file system and an
  `emptyDir` on `/tmp`.

## Settings

Each backend setting is under `backend.config`, at its default, by the name that the backend reads.
Each one has the comment that the compose file gives it.
[Configuring JAVV](../../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#backend-settings) describes each setting. The
secrets are not settings here. The secret key and the bootstrap password come from `secrets`. The
password and the CA of OpenSearch come from `opensearch`.

`values.schema.json` makes the install fail for a key with a wrong name. This does not apply in
`backend.config` and `frontend.config`, which accept each name. Thus the chart passes a setting
with a wrong name to the backend, and the backend ignores it.
`backend/tests/test_compose_settings.py` keeps the settings of this chart equal to the code.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| backend.config | object | every setting at its code default. values.yaml has the list. | Each backend setting, at its default, by the name that the backend reads (docs/CONFIGURATION.md, "Backend settings"). Set one with `--set backend.config.TZ=Europe/Bucharest`, or in your values file. The secrets are not here: see `secrets` and `opensearch`. |
| backend.extraEnv | list | `[]` | More environment variables, in the form of Kubernetes (`name`, `value` or `valueFrom`). |
| backend.image.tag | string | `"0.7.1"` | The release of this chart. release-please changes it. |
| backend.livenessProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":3,"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":"http"},"periodSeconds":20}` | Restarts a backend that does not reply. /healthz does not need OpenSearch. Thus when OpenSearch stops, the app works with less, and Kubernetes does not restart it. |
| backend.readinessProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":3,"httpGet":{"path":"/readyz","port":"http"},"periodSeconds":10}` | While OpenSearch is unreachable, /readyz replies 503, and the Service sends no requests to the backend. |
| backend.startupProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":30,"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":"http"},"periodSeconds":10}` | Stops the liveness probe while the backend starts. The backend verifies that OpenSearch replies, and creates or updates the indices before it opens its port. 30 tries, 10 s apart: ten JAVV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT periods. |
| frontend.config | object | `{"JAVV_BACKEND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT":"5","JAVV_BACKEND_URL":"","JAVV_LOG_LEVEL":"info"}` | The settings of the frontend server (docs/CONFIGURATION.md, "Frontend server settings"). |
| frontend.image.tag | string | `"0.7.1"` | The release of this chart. release-please changes it. |
| frontend.readinessProbe | object | `{"httpGet":{"path":"/","port":"http"},"periodSeconds":10}` | The frontend serves the app without the backend. Thus it stays ready while the backend is down. It then replies 502 for /api, /auth and /readyz, and the app shows "backend down". |
| frontend.replicas | int | `1` | The frontend holds no state. Thus you can run more than one. |
| frontend.service | object | `{"port":8080,"type":"ClusterIP"}` | Browsers and scanners both use this Service. The scanners push to /api/v1/ingest/scan through it. You need nothing in front of it. Your own Ingress or gateway can point at it. |
| opensearch.caSecret | object | `{"key":"ca.crt","name":""}` | A Secret with the CA of the OpenSearch certificate. For javv-opensearch with cert-manager, it is `<its release>-javv-opensearch-tls`. When you set it, the chart mounts it, sets JAVV_OPENSEARCH_CA_BUNDLE to it and sets JAVV_OPENSEARCH_VERIFY_CERTS to true. When it is empty, the backend does not verify the demo certificates. |
| opensearch.passwordSecret | object | `{"key":"password","name":""}` | The Secret with the password of javv, the OpenSearch user that JAVV signs in as. Use the Secret of the javv-opensearch chart: `opensearch.javv.backend.existingSecret` there, or `<its release>-javv-opensearch-backend`. Never use the admin Secret: the backend needs only javv. |
| podSecurityContext | object | `{"fsGroup":65532,"runAsGroup":65532,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":65532,"seccompProfile":{"type":"RuntimeDefault"}}` | Both containers run as the user of their images, with a read-only root and an emptyDir on /tmp. |
| secrets.bootstrapAdminPassword | string | `""` | The password of the first JAVV admin, 12 characters or more. The backend uses it one time, when that admin does not exist. |
| secrets.existingSecret | string | `""` | A Secret with the keys `secret-key` and `bootstrap-admin-password`. Set this value, or the two values below. The chart never makes a secret key: a new key stops each ingest token and each session. |
| secrets.secretKey | string | `""` | The secret key of the backend (`JAVV_SECRET_KEY`). It hashes the ingest tokens and the session ids, and it signs the download links. Use a long random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`), and keep it. If you change it, each scanner gets 401, and each user must sign in again. Each scanner then needs a new token. The chart puts the key in a Secret. |
