This chart installs the JAVV scanners in one cluster that you scan: a Trivy CronJob and a Grype
CronJob. Each scanner pushes its own results to JAVV. JAVV never merges them. Install the chart in
each cluster that you scan. JAVV itself, the [`javv`](../javv/README.md) chart, can run in that
cluster or at each place that the scanners can reach over HTTP.
[Connect the scanners](../../../docs/DEPLOYING.md#connect-the-scanners) gives the full procedure.

## Install

Each scanner needs its own ingest token for this cluster. Make it in JAVV: **Settings › Access &
tokens › Mint token**, with the cluster id from the first command and the name of the scanner.

```bash
kubectl get namespace kube-system -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'   # the id of this cluster in JAVV

kubectl create namespace javv-scanner
for s in trivy grype; do  # each token at a prompt: not in shell history, not in process arguments
  read -rs -p "$s token: " token && echo
  printf '%s' "$token" | kubectl -n javv-scanner create secret generic "javv-$s-token" \
    --from-file=token=/dev/stdin
done; unset token
helm install scanner oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts/javv-scanner --version <version> \
  -n javv-scanner \
  --set backendUrl=http://<JAVV's address>:8080 \
  --set trivy.token.existingSecret=javv-trivy-token \
  --set grype.token.existingSecret=javv-grype-token
helm test scanner -n javv-scanner
```

Each JAVV release publishes this chart at `oci://ghcr.io/danube-labs/charts`, and signs it
([Verify the images and charts](../../../docs/DEPLOYING.md#verify-the-images-and-charts)). From a
checkout, use the folder of the chart in `deploy/helm/`.

`helm test` verifies that JAVV replies at `backendUrl` and accepts each token. It does not scan.
Each scanner then runs on its `schedule`. To start a cycle now, follow the safe sequence in
`NOTES`:

1. Pause the CronJob.
2. Wait until no Job of that scanner runs.
3. Make a Job from the CronJob.
4. Start the CronJob again.

## What the chart runs

- **One CronJob for each scanner,** with `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`. The CronJob never starts a
  cycle while one of its own cycles runs. It does not count a Job that you make by hand, so use
  the sequence in `NOTES`. Kubernetes stops a cycle after `activeDeadlineSeconds`. The stopped
  cycle does not run again before the next schedule.
- **A cache of the vulnerability database for each scanner:** a `ReadWriteOnce`
  PersistentVolumeClaim at `/var/cache/javv`. Each run first refreshes the database there with the
  binary of the scanner, from the source of the vendor or from the source in `vulnDb`. Then it
  scans with updates off. Thus each image in a cycle gets the same database, and the scan does not
  connect to the vendor. Trivy uses the misconfiguration rules in its binary.
    - If the refresh fails, the run uses the database in the cache.
    - If the scanner cannot read the database, the refresh deletes it and downloads it one more
      time.
    - With no database that it can read, the run fails, and its log tells you why.
    - The refresh also verifies the Java database of Trivy. A damaged Java database fails no scan:
      Trivy only skips the jars that it cannot name.
    - Grype refuses a database older than 5 days.
- **Mirrors:** `trivy.vulnDb.repository` and `trivy.vulnDb.javaRepository` take OCI repositories.
  `grype.vulnDb.updateUrl` takes the address of a list of database builds. Put each other setting
  that the vendors read in `extraEnv`, for example `GRYPE_DB_CA_CERT` or the registry login for a
  private mirror.
- **Kubernetes access:** one ClusterRole. It can `list` pods, to find the running images. It can
  `get` the `kube-system` namespace, because its UID is the id of the cluster. It cannot read
  Secrets. Thus the scanners do not scan images from private registries yet
  ([issue 739](https://github.com/Danube-Labs/javv-poc/issues/739)).
- Both scanners run as the user of their images, `65532`, with a read-only root file system. They
  have the cache volume, an `emptyDir` on `/var/lib/javv` for the dead-letter file, and an
  `emptyDir` on `/tmp`.

## Images

`image.tag` is the scanner version from `versions.yaml` in the repository. JAVV publishes that tag
again when it changes the scanner image. Thus the default `pullPolicy` is `Always`. To run one
exact build, set `image.digest`. **The chart of a release sets the digest.** For each scanner, it
is the digest that the tag named when JAVV made the release, after cosign verified the signature
of `scanner-images.yml`. A checkout of the repository has the tag only.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| backendUrl | string | `""` | The address of JAVV, as the scanners reach it: the frontend Service of the javv chart, or what you put in front of it. Examples: `http://javv.javv.svc:8080` in the same cluster, and `https://javv.example.com` from a different cluster. You must set it. |
| clusterId | string | `""` | The id of this cluster in JAVV. When it is empty, the scanners read the UID of the `kube-system` namespace. When you set it, the scanners verify it: a cycle that reaches a different cluster stops, and does not scan. |
| grype.activeDeadlineSeconds | int | `19800` | Kubernetes stops a cycle that runs for longer than this number of seconds. |
| grype.config | object | every setting at its code default. values.yaml has the list. | The scan settings of Grype (docs/CONFIGURATION.md, "Grype settings"), at their defaults. An empty value means not set. |
| grype.enabled | bool | `true` | Run the Grype CronJob. |
| grype.extraEnv | list | `[]` | More environment variables for the refresh and the scan, in the form of Kubernetes. |
| grype.image.digest | string | `""` | `sha256:...`: run exactly that image. It replaces `tag`. It is empty in the repository. The chart of a release sets it to the digest that the tag named at the release. |
| grype.image.tag | string | `"0.120.1"` | The Grype version, from versions.yaml (`scanners.grype.current`). JAVV publishes the tag again when it changes the image for that version. Thus each run pulls the image. |
| grype.schedule | string | `"30 */6 * * *"` | When a cycle starts, in the time zone of the CronJob. |
| grype.timeZone | string | `""` | The time zone of `schedule`. When it is empty, the zone of the cluster applies, which is UTC on most clusters. |
| grype.token | object | `{"existingSecret":"","key":"token","value":""}` | The ingest token that JAVV made for this cluster and Grype. Give a Secret that holds it under `key`. Or give `value`, and the chart puts it in a Secret. |
| grype.vulnDb.existingClaim | string | `""` | Your own PersistentVolumeClaim. The chart then makes no claim. |
| grype.vulnDb.size | string | `"10Gi"` | The cache volume. In October 2026, the Grype database used 3.0 GB. This size gives it space to grow. |
| grype.vulnDb.storageClass | string | `""` | When it is empty, the default StorageClass of the cluster applies. |
| grype.vulnDb.updateUrl | string | `""` | The source of the vulnerability database (`GRYPE_DB_UPDATE_URL`, the list of database builds). When it is empty, Grype uses `https://grype.anchore.io/databases`. |
| podSecurityContext | object | `{"fsGroup":65532,"runAsGroup":65532,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":65532,"seccompProfile":{"type":"RuntimeDefault"}}` | Both scanners run as the user of their images, with a read-only root. They write only to the database cache, the dead-letter file and /tmp. |
| trivy.activeDeadlineSeconds | int | `19800` | Kubernetes stops a cycle that runs for longer than this number of seconds. Only one cycle runs at a time, so a cycle that does not end would stop each later cycle. |
| trivy.config | object | every setting at its code default. values.yaml has the list. | The scan settings of Trivy (docs/CONFIGURATION.md, "Trivy settings"), at their defaults. An empty value means not set. |
| trivy.enabled | bool | `true` | Run the Trivy CronJob. |
| trivy.extraEnv | list | `[]` | More environment variables for the refresh and the scan, in the form of Kubernetes. |
| trivy.image.digest | string | `""` | `sha256:...`: run exactly that image. It replaces `tag`. It is empty in the repository. The chart of a release sets it to the digest that the tag named at the release. |
| trivy.image.tag | string | `"0.75.0"` | The Trivy version, from versions.yaml (`scanners.trivy.current`). JAVV publishes the tag again when it changes the image for that version. Thus each run pulls the image. |
| trivy.schedule | string | `"0 */6 * * *"` | When a cycle starts, in the time zone of the CronJob. A cycle each 6 hours keeps each finding well inside the 3-day staleness window of JAVV. Grype runs half an hour later, so the two downloads do not occur at the same time. |
| trivy.timeZone | string | `""` | The time zone of `schedule`, for example `Europe/Bucharest`. When it is empty, the zone of the cluster applies, which is UTC on most clusters. |
| trivy.token | object | `{"existingSecret":"","key":"token","value":""}` | The ingest token that JAVV made for this cluster and Trivy (Settings › Access & tokens). Give a Secret that holds it under `key`. Or give `value`, and the chart puts it in a Secret. |
| trivy.vulnDb.existingClaim | string | `""` | Your own PersistentVolumeClaim. The chart then makes no claim. |
| trivy.vulnDb.javaRepository | string | `""` | The source of the Java index database (`--java-db-repository`). When it is empty, Trivy uses `mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-java-db:1`, then `ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-java-db:1`. |
| trivy.vulnDb.repository | string | `""` | The source of the vulnerability database (`--db-repository`, OCI repositories in sequence). When it is empty, Trivy uses `mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-db:2`, then `ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2`. |
| trivy.vulnDb.size | string | `"10Gi"` | The cache volume. In October 2026, the two Trivy databases used 2.9 GB. This size gives them space to grow. |
| trivy.vulnDb.storageClass | string | `""` | When it is empty, the default StorageClass of the cluster applies. |
